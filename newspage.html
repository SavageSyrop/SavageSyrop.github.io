            <h5>Expensive purchase</h5>
            <p>
                Getting a new car is always exciting. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment and not realise that there may be extra costs involved past the vehicle’s selling price. For instance, stamp duty applies to any transfer of ownership, including properties and cars.
                If you buy a new or used car, you’ll need to factor the cost of vehicle stamp duty into the final price.

            <h5>New Mustang</h5>
            <p>The new-look cars are much closer to what you find on the street, with many of the panels effectively interchangeable between the two - something that cannot be said for the current highly-modified Mustang and Holden Commodore.

                While all panels are made from composite materials to save cost and weight, the doors, bonnet, boot and roof, as well as the lights and glasshouse, are all identical in dimensions to the road-going equivalents.

                To provide a more aggressive and purposeful look, both models feature ‘pumped out’ front and rear guards, as well as racing-style front spoiler and a rear wing.</p>
